# Machine Learning - Regression

**Question:**  
Using the **Energy Efficiency dataset** (768 records, 14 columns), apply the following machine learning models to predict the **Heating Load (Y1)** and **Cooling Load (Y2)** of buildings:

- **Linear Regression**  
- **Random Forest Regression**  
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

The dataset contains 8 features (X1 to X8) that influence energy efficiency, and it has no missing values.  

ðŸ‘‰ Your task is to:

1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Perform necessary preprocessing (e.g., normalization, handling missing values if any).
3. Visualize the relationships between features and targets.
4. Train a regression model (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict `Y1` and `Y2`.
5. Evaluate the models' performances using appropriate metrics (MAE, RMSE, RÂ²).
6. Interpret the results: Which features have the most impact on heating and cooling loads?
