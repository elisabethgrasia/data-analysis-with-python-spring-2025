# Introduction to Machine Learning

Imagine teaching a dog new tricks, but instead of you explicitly telling it what to do every time, you show it examples and let it figure out the patterns. That's kind of what ML does with computers.

Instead of writing explicit code for every single task, you feed computers data, and ML algorithms allow them to learn patterns from that data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## **1. What is Machine Learning?**

**Definition**:  
Machine Learning (ML) is a method where computers **learn from data** to make predictions or decisions **without being explicitly programmed** for each task.

**Example**:  

- You want to detect spam emails.  
- You collect thousands of emails labeled “spam” or “not spam”.
- The model learns patterns (like “Win a prize!”, or unknown senders).  
- It then predicts if new incoming emails are spam.

### **2. Types of Machine Learning**

#### **A. Supervised Learning**

- **You provide both input and expected output.**  
- The model learns to map inputs to outputs.

**Example**:  
Predict house prices from size, location, etc.
You give the model data like:

```
Size (sq ft) | Bedrooms | Price
-------------|----------|--------
  1500       |    3     | $300,000
  2000       |    4     | $400,000
```

The model learns to predict price based on size and number of bedrooms.

Common algorithms:  

- **Linear Regression** – for predicting numbers  
- **Logistic Regression** – for binary outcomes (yes/no)  
- **Random Forest** – powerful for both classification and regression

---

#### **B. Unsupervised Learning**

- **No labels**, only input data.
- Learn patterns from unlabeled data.
- The model finds patterns or groups on its own.

**Example**:  
You have customer data:  

```
Age | Income
----|--------
 23 | 30k
 45 | 100k
 24 | 32k
 44 | 98k
```

The model might group them into two clusters:

- Cluster 1: Young and low income  
- Cluster 2: Older and high income

Algorithms:

- **K-Means Clustering** – group similar data  
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** – reduce data dimensions
- ** Hierarchical Clustering* -  is an unsupervised learning method that builds nested clusters by either merging or splitting data points based on similarity

---

#### **C. Reinforcement Learning**

- Learn by interacting with an environment and getting rewards or penalties.
- The model **learns by trial and error**.  
- It gets **rewards or penalties** based on actions taken.

**Example**:  
A robot learns to walk:

- Falls? Penalty.
- Walks straight? Reward.
- Over time, it learns the best moves to walk efficiently.

Used in:

- Self-driving cars  
- Games (like AlphaGo or chess AI)

### **3. Basic Steps in an ML Project**

Let’s take the **example of predicting student exam scores** based on study hours.

#### 1. **Collect Data**

```text
Study Hours | Score
------------|-------
     1      |  50
     2      |  55
     3      |  65
     4      |  70
     5      |  75
```

#### 2. **Preprocess Data**

- Fill missing values
- Normalize study hours
- Convert text to numbers if needed

#### 3. **Choose a Model**

- For this: **Linear Regression**

#### 4. **Train the Model**

- Let the model learn the pattern:
  `Score = 45 + 6 * (Hours studied)`

#### 5. **Evaluate the Model**

- Use test data (not seen before) and compare predicted vs actual scores.
- Use **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to measure accuracy.

#### 6. **Tune & Improve**

- Add more features (like sleep hours, attendance)
- Try other algorithms like Decision Tree

#### 7. **Deploy**

- Build a web app that predicts scores based on study hours input.

### **4. Popular Tools & Libraries**

#### Language

- **Python** – easy and powerful for ML

#### Libraries

- **Pandas** – handle and analyze data tables  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Scikit-learn** – prebuilt ML models (regression, classification, etc.)  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – graphs & plots  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** – advanced deep learning

---

### **5. Key Concepts**

- **Features**: Inputs to the model  
  → `study_hours`, `age`, `income`

- **Labels**: What you want to predict  
  → `exam_score`, `spam_or_not`, `price`

- **Overfitting**: Model is too specific to training data  
  → When your model memorizes training data
  → Great on training set, poor on real data.

- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple
  → When your model is too simple
  → Misses important patterns.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: % of correct predictions  
  - **Precision**: Out of predicted positives, how many are actually positive  
  - **Recall**: Out of all actual positives, how many did the model find  
  - **F1 Score**: A balance between precision & recall

### Summary (TL;DR)

- ML helps computers learn from data.
- 3 types: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement.
- Workflow: collect → clean → train → evaluate → improve → deploy.
- Use Python + Scikit-learn to get started.
